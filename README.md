# Udemy Web App Challenge
## Aim
The aim of the project is to build a full stack web application that has a quiz module and my portfolio. The quiz has 12 questions scored out of 100. Once a user registers/logs
into the website, they will be shown their highest score if they have taken the quiz along with the top scorers chart from all the users and a pie chart showing the distribution
of people above and below average using ChartJS. The user can decide to take the quiz more than once and the best score will be displayed on the profile. The application also has
user authentication and authorization using Java Web Tokens(JWT). 
## Full Stack Web Application
<ol>
  <li><strong>Frontend</strong> : Angular 11</li>
  <li><strong>Backend</strong> : .Net Core 5</li>
  <li><strong>Database</strong> : SQL Server</li>
  <li><strong>Description</strong> : Quiz + Portfolio</li>
</ol>

During my undergraduate final semester internship, I had worked as a Full Stack Web Developer Intern and had worked with the above mentioned Stack. 

My goal is to continue working
on this website and add more features and showcase my projects and try to integrate some as well as add more features.

The application is hosted using azure and firebase.
